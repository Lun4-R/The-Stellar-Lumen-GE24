# The Stellar Lumen GE24

The Stellar Lumen (TSL) is a TMT mod that I created during the summer of 2023, specifically from May to August.

This mod aims to provide a single-layer experience using the TMT engine. The code has been refactored for overall development improvement. It also utilizes my special, fine-tuned modification of the TMT engine, enabling more extensive capabilities compared to the vanilla TMT engine.

**Contributions are always welcome.**
PS. Art for this game is made entirely by me, and since they also use the MIT license, that means you can use them, sell them, modify them if you want, even without crediting me.
